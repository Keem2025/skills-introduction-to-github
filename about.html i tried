<h1>All About A'keem</h1>
<p> My name is A'keem Clinton and I am a former graduate of LeMoyne-Owen College with a Bachelor's Degree in Music.</p>
<p> I do aspire to become a software developer, as i am in the process of getting my feet wet in terms of learning this complex skill.</p>
<p> One of my top favorite foods is fried or grilled chicken wings.</p>
